# CoqStoq
Benchmark and Dataset for Training and Testing Coq proof search tools.  

## Using the benchmark  
- This dataset is intended to be used via docker.  
- To see how to use this dataset outside of docker, simply reference the [Dockerfile](Dockerfile)

### Cloning the repository
```
git clone -b deepproof-full https://github.com/rkthomps/CoqStoq --recurse-submodules
```

### Building the docker image
Please allow for 1-2 hours to build the image.
```
cd CoqStoq
docker build -t coqstoq-full .
```

### Running commands
Verification Server
========================================
1. Starting the verification server
```
# Note the number of workers **MUST BE 1**. The number of threads should be approximately # cpus / 4
docker run -p 8080:8080 coqstoq-full poetry run gunicorn coqstoq.checker_server.server:application --bind 0.0.0.0:8080 --workers 1 --threads 8
```

2. Calling the verification server
```
Once the verification engine is started, you can call it (from the host machine) through requests like the following:
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080 \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
        "jsonrpc": "2.0",
        "method": "check_proof",
        "params": {
          "split": "val",
          "idx": 0,
          "coqstoq_loc": ".",
          "proof": "Proof. Qed.", "timeout": 120},
        "id": 1
      }'
```

3. **You should follow example.py for an example of calling the verification server programatically**. It shows how to call the server in parallel on the first 50 ground truth solutions from the train-sft split.  


Get the available splits:
===========================
docker run coqstoq-full poetry run python3 api.py get_splits

Expected output:
{
  "splits": [
    "train-sft",
    "train-rl",
    "val",
    "cutoff",
    "test",
  ]
}


Get the number of examples in a split:
========================================
docker run coqstoq-full poetry run python3 api.py get_num_theorems train-rl

Expected output:
{
  "num_theorems": 80274 
}


Get the relevant information about an example:
========================================
docker run coqstoq-full poetry run python3 api.py get_theorem_info train-sft 3001 

Expected output:
{
  "split": "train-rl",
  "index": 3001,
  "prefix": ...  # the portion of the file comming before the theorem
  "suffix": ...  # the portion of the file comming after the proof 
  "theorem": ... # the theorem statement
  "groud_truth": ... # the human-written proof
}


Get the relevant information about a range of examples:
========================================
docker run coqstoq-full poetry run python3 api.py get_theorem_range train-sft 3 5 

Expected output:
[
  {
    "split": "train-rl",
    "index": 3,
    "prefix": ...,
    "suffix": ...,
    "theorem": ...,
    "ground_truth": ...,
  },
  {
    "split": "train-rl",
    "index": 4,
    "prefix": ...,
    "suffix": ...,
    "theorem": ...,
    "ground_truth": ...,
  },
]

```
